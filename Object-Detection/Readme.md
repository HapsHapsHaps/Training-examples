This folder consists of guides and files, on how to train and use a TensorFlow object classifier with images.  
These guides is put together through a ton of trial and error, with documentation, various guides and code examples used to create working prototypes.
I've tried to include links to the most prominent ones for each guide.

## Note!
The final Java implementation for Object-Detection and Classification with Tensorflow is in following repository:  
[Java Object-Detection and Classification](https://github.com/HapsHapsHaps/machinelearning-subs)

These guides consists of 5 parts:
* How to create and label a dataset to train on.
* How to train an object classfier with images
* How to test the model with python
* How to use the model with java
* How to setup and use Nvidia GPU accelerated training with docker on Fedora 28.

Enjoy.
